## 🔡 Passwords Tested and Results

| Password         | Strength     | Time to Crack     | Tool Feedback                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `password123`    | Very Weak    | 0 seconds         | Contains a common word and predictable sequence (`password` + `123`).        |
| `P@$w0rd!`       | Weak         | 8.15 minutes      | Contains dictionary word, weak despite complexity.                           |
| `T&8kZ`          | Medium       | 4 days            | Short but random with mix of characters.                                     |
| `P&$$W0rdd`      | Strong       | 2 years           | Good length and complexity. Safe for temporary use.                          |
|   P&$$W0r|]      | Very Strong  | 858 years         | Complex, unique, and secure. Strong against brute force attacks.             |

## 🧠 What Makes a Password Strong?

A strong password:
- Is **at least 12–15 characters** long.
- Contains **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoids **dictionary words** and **common sequences** (like `123`, `abc`, or `qwerty`).
- Is **not reused** across multiple sites.

---

## 🔐 Password Tips

- Use **passphrases** with special characters (e.g., `MyC@tR@nsFast77!`).
- Use a **password manager** to generate and store complex passwords.
- Update passwords regularly, especially after a breach.
- Avoid using **names**, **birthdays**, or **easy patterns**.

## 💣 Common Password Attack Methods

| Attack Type         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force          | Tries every possible combination of characters.                             |
| Dictionary Attack    | Uses common password lists and words to guess passwords.                    |
| Credential Stuffing  | Uses leaked passwords from one site on others where you might reuse them.   |
| Social Engineering   | Tricking users into revealing passwords (phishing, fake login pages, etc.). |

## 🔍 Password Complexity vs. Security

- Simple passwords (like `password123`) are cracked instantly.
- Moderate ones (like `P@$w0rd!`) survive minutes.
- Complex passwords (`P&$$W0r|]`) can resist cracking for **hundreds of years**.

---

## ✅ Outcome

This task improved my understanding of:
- How to **evaluate password strength**.
- Why **length and complexity** matter.
- How to **avoid weak patterns** and boost password security.
- The **importance of unique, strong passwords** per account.
